            "We pitched our initial ideas on Tuesday. These ideas consisted of a computer mouse in a glove, a holiday-themed image-displaying necklace, a local UV detector, "
            + "a health-monitoring watch. After discussing, we settled on the idea of the computer mouse in a glove.",
            "So far, we have brainstormed what the functions of the mouse would be and have decided necessities are right click, left click, and moving the mouse."
            + " We have looked into ways we could implement these functions including using conductive fabric for completing a circuit between thumb and two other fingers for the clicks,"
            + " as well as researching an accelerometer and gyroscope sensor (1)(2) we could use for converting hand movement to mouse movement. "
            + "Additionally we have looked into previous solutions (3) to this problem to get ideas and also see what we could try to improve."
